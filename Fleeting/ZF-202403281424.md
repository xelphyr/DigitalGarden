# Quicksort
Divide and conquer alg, same as mergesort but every iteration you split it in terms of items greater than a predetermined 'pivot' item in the list (usually a[0]). That way during merging back you can just append them, but it has a worst-case complexity of O(n^2). However, normal case is $\theta (n \log n)$.
