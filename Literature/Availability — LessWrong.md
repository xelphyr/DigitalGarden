## Highlights

> The _availability heuristic_ is judging the frequency or probability of an event by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/availability-less-wrong-18e845d5cb0#2d8b5be1-ec56-4e24-ba3e-2c4f5a8453d2)  ^2d8b5be1

> An obvious hypothesis to account for these skewed beliefs is that murders are more likely to be talked about than suicides—thus, someone is more likely to recall hearing about a murder than hearing about a suicide. Accidents are more dramatic than diseases—perhaps this makes people more likely to remember, or more likely to recall, an accident.

> Selective reporting is one major source of availability biases. In the ancestral environment, much of what you knew, you experienced yourself; or you heard it directly from a fellow tribe-member who had seen it. There was usually at most one layer of selective reporting between you, and the event itself. With today’s Internet, you may see reports that have passed through the hands of six bloggers on the way to you—six successive filters. Compared to our ancestors, we live in a larger world, in which far more happens, and far less of it reaches us—a much stronger selection effect, which can create much larger availability biases.

> The objective frequency of Bill Gates is 0.00000000015, but you hear about him much more often. Conversely, 19% of the planet lives on less than $1/day, and I doubt that one fifth of the blog posts you read are written by them.

> Using availability seems to give rise to an [absurdity bias](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/j4/absurdity%5Fheuristic%5Fabsurdity%5Fbias/); events that have never happened are not recalled, and hence deemed to have probability zero. When no flooding has recently occurred (and yet the probabilities are still fairly calculable), people refuse to buy flood insurance even when it is heavily subsidized and priced far below an actuarially fair value. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/availability-less-wrong-18e845d5cb0#dd43e0b2-5399-4827-8172-ae46481a3123)  ^dd43e0b2

> Burton et al. report that when dams and levees are built, they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions.2 While building dams decreases the _frequency_ of floods, damage _per flood_ is afterward so much greater that average yearly damage _increases_. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/availability-less-wrong-18e845d5cb0#f14c2488-b49e-4d53-8f71-88d3a3a74c06)  ^f14c2488

> The wise would extrapolate from a memory of small hazards to the possibility of large hazards. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/availability-less-wrong-18e845d5cb0#6c695540-4260-4aca-bfad-4aa286130d69)  ^6c695540

> A society subject to regular minor hazards treats those minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of the risks, guarding against regular minor floods but not occasional major floods.

> Memory is not always a good guide to probabilities in the past, let alone in the future. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/availability-less-wrong-18e845d5cb0#670535e0-1c45-496b-aea0-494ec7aaafe5)  ^670535e0
