## Highlights

> This random error is the cost of incomplete knowledge, and as errors go, it’s not so bad. Your estimates won’t be incorrect _on average_, and the more you learn, the smaller your error will tend to be. 
> 
> On the other hand, suppose that the white balls are heavier, and sink to the bottom of the urn. Then your sample may be unrepresentative in a consistent direction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#3a57a7a5-ec1d-4689-9b10-c0d047dd4d04)  ^3a57a7a5

> _That_  kind of error is called “statistical bias.” When your method of learning about the world is biased, learning more may not help. Acquiring more data can even consistently _worsen_ a biased prediction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#7e2c9b96-f3b0-4858-b2f3-6cbd93282b55)  ^7e2c9b96

> we need to discover and correct for biases in our data. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#3c181e65-bc40-482d-95d0-2eef998b102c)  ^3c181e65

> Whereas statistical bias skews a sample so that it less closely resembles a larger population, cognitive biases skew our thinking so that it less accurately tracks the truth (or less reliably serves our other goals). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#2215e5cb-a9e5-443b-a55e-59e7b0bca5e6)  ^2215e5cb

> Maybe you have an optimism bias, and you find out that the red balls can be used to treat a rare tropical disease besetting your brother, and you end up overestimating how many red balls the urn contains because you _wish_ the balls were mostly red.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#18d60368-a50c-43fa-9468-391e71552d5c)  ^18d60368

> _base rate neglect_ : grounding one’s judgments in how well sets of characteristics feel like they fit together, and neglecting how common each characteristic is in the population at large.² [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#7ac69b47-7faf-4b65-abd3-0c64e28d87c6)  ^7ac69b47

> _sunk cost fallacy_ —people’s tendency to feel committed to things they’ve spent resources on in the past, when they should be cutting their losses and moving on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#6ab57782-b82c-4fe0-bca2-aa32e65b3154)  ^6ab57782

> experimental subjects predicted that they would have a harder time neutrally evaluating the quality of paintings if they knew the paintings were by famous artists. And indeed, these subjects exhibited the very bias they had predicted when the experimenters later tested their prediction. When asked _afterward_, however, the very same subjects claimed that their assessments of the paintings had been objective and unaffected by the bias.³ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#7186bb44-d2dd-4545-a4f4-828e9d9fc702)  ^7186bb44

> _bias blind spot_  when it comes to our own flaws.⁴ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#7560c4fe-9f9e-4696-97b7-513fcd4718c0)  ^7560c4fe

> who notes that “years of financially related work experience” didn’t affect people’s susceptibility to the sunk cost bias, whereas “the number of accounting courses attended” did help.

> _Rationality: From AI to Zombies_ .⁷ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/biases-an-introduction-less-wrong-18e844c0ade#43061a81-8a80-4cf5-b84c-e422c4a1eb77)  ^43061a81
