## Highlights

> 2,000 / 20,000 / 200,000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#980554c9-da37-4edb-97be-1c41866db5ed)  ^980554c9

> _scope insensitivity_  or _scope neglect_: the number of birds saved—the _scope_ of the altruistic action—had little effect on willingness to pay. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#880c0b40-24cc-4825-b805-2fed71d8d8f1)  ^880c0b40

> This image, or _prototype_, calls forth some level of emotional arousal that is primarily responsible for willingness-to-pay—and the image is the same in all cases. As for scope, it gets tossed out the window—no human can visualize 2,000 birds at once, let alone 200,000. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#1aac0020-5fa8-4c47-83f9-cc6f48e96f38)  ^1aac0020

> The usual finding is that _exponential_ increases in scope create _linear_ increases in willingness-to-pay—perhaps corresponding to the linear time for our eyes to glaze over the zeroes; this small amount of affect is added, not multiplied, with the prototype affect. This hypothesis is known as “valuation by prototype.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#5d95edb4-3c3b-4a27-a27c-913f50da8dd3)  ^5d95edb4

> An alternative hypothesis is “purchase of moral satisfaction.” People spend enough money to create a _warm glow_ in themselves, a sense of having done their duty. The level of spending needed to purchase a warm glow depends on personality and financial situation, but it certainly has nothing to do with the number of birds.

> Increasing the alleged risk of chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to 2.43 annual deaths per 1,000—a factor of 600—increased willingness-to-pay from $3.78 to $15.23.4 Baron and Greene found no effect from varying lives saved by a factor of 10.5 [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#75f71404-cda1-4c06-94b9-f4370afa43e9)  ^75f71404

> Weber’s Law—obeys a logarithmic scale where the “just noticeable difference” is a constant fraction of the whole. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/scope-insensitivity-less-wrong-18e8454483c#47d8788a-f1ce-4882-8f3b-a00ebcfb23b2)  ^47d8788a

> If you want to be an effective altruist, you have to think it through with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting inky zeroes on paper, not just the part that gets real worked up about that poor struggling oil-soaked bird.
