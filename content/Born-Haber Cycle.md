The Born-Haber Cycle is used for calculating [[Lattice Energy]] or [[Enthalpy Change of Formation]].

>[!important] Note
>$\Delta H_{1}+\Delta H_{latt}=\Delta H_{f}$

$\Delta H_1$ is the sum of enthalpies when you convert the elements in their standard states into gaseous ions, ready to be converted into the ionic compound.
