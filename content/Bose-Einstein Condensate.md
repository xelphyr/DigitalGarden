Formed when compounds are cooled close to absolute zero.

## Idea
Quantum particles consist primarily of two groups - [[bosons]] and [[fermions]]. Bosons have an integer spin, while fermions have half-spins. According to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], fermions cannot be in the same state or configuration, while bosons can. 

Hypothetically, an unlimited number of bosons could share the same energy state, and be mapped out by a single [wave function](Quantum%20Mechanics). Einstein also proved that this happens to even-spin bosons at low enough temperatures.
