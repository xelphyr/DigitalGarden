>In other words, it is the force experienced by a charge due to an electric field **per unit positive charge**


There are three formulas used to calculate the strength of an electric field:
- When field is uniform (aka field lines are straight, parallel and equidistant, same strength anywhere in the field)
	- An example of this is two charged electric plates
	- the field strength in this setup is 
		- proportional to the [[voltage]] difference of the two plates (which facilitates the field)
		- inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.
  $$E=- \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}$$
- When field is non-uniform
	- An example of this is the field caused by a point charge, or two point charges interacting with each other. 
	- Using the second definition, we know that field strength is force per unit positive charge.
	  $$E=\frac{ F}{ Q}  $$
- General case
	- Using Coulomb's Law, we can derive that:
	  $$E = \frac{kQ}{r^{2}}$$
