>[!Definition] 
>$EA_n$ is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of gaseous $(n-1)^-$ ions of an element to form 1 mole of gaseous $n^-$ ions. Opposite of [[ionization energy]]

$EA_{1}$ is exothermic (gives out energy) because there are attractive forces between the nucleus and the electron, which means the link is easier to form.

Every other $EA$ is endothermic (takes in energy) because the negative charge of the ion repels the newly-added electron, so you have to put in energy for the electron to remain.

Not to be confused with $E_a$, the [[activation energy]] of a reaction.
