>Enthalpy Change when 1 [[Mole]] of gaseous atoms is formed from its element (under [[standard conditions]])

Written as $\Delta H_{at}^⦵$.

It is basically the energy required to turn some element (be it $Na(s)$ or $\dfrac{1}{2}Cl_2(g)$ ) into gaseous atoms (like $Na(g)$ or $Cl(g)$)

>[!important] 
>$\Delta H_{at}^⦵$ is always +ve.
