>[!Definition] 
>The enthalpy change when 1 [[Mole]] of a specified gaseous ion dissolves in sufficient water to form a very dilute solution

Here, 'specified' means that there can only be 1 type of gaseous ion - You can't have a mole of $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions, just $Na^+$ or just $Cl^-$

This is different from [[enthalpy change of solution]] because you don't have to overcome the [[lattice energy]] of the compound.

To calculate this value, see [[Calculating Enthalpy Change of Solution and Hydration]]
