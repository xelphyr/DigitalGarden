>[!Definition] 
>The enthalpy change when 1 [[Mole]] of an ionic solid is dissolved in sufficient water to form a very dilute solution

This is different from [[enthalpy change of hydration]] in that you also have to overcome the [[lattice energy]] of the compound before it dissolves.

To calculate this value, see [[Calculating Enthalpy Change of Solution and Hydration]]
