It is a state of rest or balance due to equal and opposite forces.
## Equilibrium in Chemistry
Reactions can be in equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction ($left \to right$) is equal to rate of backward reaction ($left \leftarrow right$) and the reaction is closed.

This is due to the [entropy](Entropy and Equilibrium) of both reactions being equal, hence they both happen at a balance.

A equilibrium reaction is usually represented in the form $reagents_{LHS} \rightleftharpoons reagent_{RHS}$

In an equilibrium reaction:
- The reaction is dynamic, i.e. the forward and backward reactions keep happening
- The rate of forward and backward reactions are the same, casing equilibrium.
- Concentration of products and reactants are constant

Changes in pressure, temperature and concentration can change the equilibrium position - see [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]

>[[Catalysts]] do not affect the position of equilibrium.

See [[Equilibrium Constants]] and [[Partial Pressure]].
