>[!definition]
>    A quantity used to measure the maximum amount of work done in a [[thermodynamic system]] where the pressure and temperature remain constant.

It is a combination of the Enthalpy Change of Reaction and the temperature times the [[entropy]] change of the reaction.

>[!Important]
>When $\Delta G_{total}^{⦵}>0$, reactants are favoured to products (reaction is not feasible)
>When $\Delta G_{total}^{⦵}=0$, reactants and products are in equilibrium ($\leftrightharpoons$)
>When $\Delta G_{total}^{⦵}<0$ products are favoured to reactants (reaction is feasible)


This isn't strict - the closer $\Delta G_{total}^{⦵}$ is to 0, the less completion and more of an equilibrium reaction it has. 

Take the example of boiling - for $\Delta G_{total}^{⦵}$ to be equal to 0, the temperature must equal 100$°C$. However, evaporation occurs before that temperature as well, and increases as you get closer to 100$°C$. 

Even after 100$°C$, steam appears white because some vapor particles condense back into water droplets, and steam becomes more transparent as the temperature increases.

## Formulas
$$\Delta G^{⦵}=\Delta H^⦵_{reaction}-T \Delta S^⦵_{system}$$
$$\Delta G^{⦵}=-T \Delta S_{total}^⦵ $$
See [[Electrode Potential]]:
$$\Delta G^⦵=-nFE_{cell}^⦵$$
