> [!definition] Literal Definition
>Iconoclasm comes from greek '_eik≈çn_' - likeness and '_klan_' - to break. Literal translation - 'Likeness breaking' or 'Image breaking'

The act of questioning and assertively rejecting cherished or established beliefs, institutions, values and practices.

Its original definition was a lot narrower - it used to be the act of destroying images for political or religious purposes, a common happening in the ancient and medieval era as new rulers destroyed images of their predecessors, and revolutions destroyed the symbolism of their regime.

While this allows the person to be less 'unbiased' by not conforming to societal norms, it may not always be the best solution - see [[Chesterton's Fence]].

## Byzantine Iconoclasm
In the days of the Byzantine Empire, questions were raised about the worship of religious icons - like the statue of Jesus Christ or the painting of St. Joseph. The main argument was the worry that prayer was shifting towards the 'image' rather than the person themselves, and the Old Testament prohibitions against the worship of any images.
