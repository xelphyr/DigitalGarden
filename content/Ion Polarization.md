The strength of Ion Polarization is affected by:
- Charge Density of cation $(c\uparrow, i\uparrow)$
- Size of Cation $(s\uparrow, i\downarrow)$

For a cation, the strength:
- across the period $\uparrow$ 
	- more nuclear charge but same electron cloud size = smaller radii
- down the group $\downarrow$ 
	- more nuclear charge, but electron cloud is much larger = larger radii
