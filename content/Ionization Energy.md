>[!Definition]
>$IE_{n}$ is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of electrons is removed from 1 mole of gaseous $(n-1)^+$ ions of an element to form $n^+$ ions. Opposite of [[electron affinity]]

$IE_n$ is always endothermic because you need to add energy to remove electrons. As $n$ increases, $IE_n$ increases as well due to the increasingly positive charge of the cation creating stronger attractive forces between the nucleus and its electrons.
