As $\Delta H_{lat}$ increases, ionic bond strength $\uparrow$, compound stability $\uparrow$.

$\Delta H_{lat}$ depends on the radii of the atom and the charge of the atom. In particular,

$$\Delta H_{lat}\propto \text{Charge of the atom}$$
$$\Delta H_{lat}\propto \dfrac{1}{\text{Radii of the atom}}$$
>[!INFO] Note
> $\Delta H_{lat}\text{ is always exothermic } (<0)$
