Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic discovered by H.C. von Warnsdorff, used to solve the [[Knight's Tour]] problem. This heuristic can be applied from anywhere on the board.

>[!important] Rule
>Every turn, move the knight to an unvisited square with the fewest incoming moves

This reduces the complexity of the Knight's Tour Problem from $O(8^{n^2})$ to $O(n^2)$, solving the problem in linear time.
