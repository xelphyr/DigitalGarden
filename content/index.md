I'm Joseph Joe P (or Joseph, or Jojo) offline, or varying versions of Xelphyr (xelphyr_, xelphyrwastaken, etc.) online. Welcome to my garden! 

It's a pretty humble affair, but I'm sure you'll have a grand time looking around, and it's bound to grow in the future. A few landscape features you can look out for:
- The pillars, where information from the garden coalesces into ever-changing posts on a variety of topics.
- The beach, where you can join me in the reflection and contemplation of our future and past. 

(Side-note - Most of these are to-be-made, so you'll have to wait a bit :< )

I'd say, however (as the gardener), that the best way to experience the garden is just wandering about.

Here are some paths you can walk down
